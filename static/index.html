        Hi, I'm Nathan Bird. Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I'm in my third year at BYU-Idaho studying
        Software
        Engineering, currently interning as a Web Backend Developer at FamilySearch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in building and maintaining backend REST APIs and enjoy exploring new technologies. Feel free to
        explore my site and see what I've been working on!
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE&sup1;: Projects are listed in reverse chronological order and may refer to earlier projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE&sup2;: Many projects listed here reference a class I took at BYU-I in Fall 2023 where I worked on a new
        project every 2 weeks. Most of these projects were quick to write and insightful about a certain language or
        principle, and already had a demo video made for them which made them perfect/really easy to add for this
        portfolio page.
