      <h2>About Me </h2>
      <i>(Last updated Mid 2024)</i>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Nathan Bird. Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I'm in my third year at BYU-Idaho studying
        Software
        Engineering, currently interning as a Web Backend Developer at FamilySearch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in building and maintaining backend REST APIs and enjoy exploring new technologies. Feel free to
        explore my site and see what I've been working on!
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE&sup1;: Projects are listed in reverse chronological order and may refer to earlier projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE&sup2;: Many projects listed here reference a class I took at BYU-I in Fall 2023 where I worked on a new
        project every 2 weeks. Most of these projects were quick to write and insightful about a certain language or
        principle, and already had a demo video made for them which made them perfect/really easy to add for this
        portfolio page.

      <h2>QuickPen</h2>
      <i>Mid 2024</i>
      <p>
        This is an app that my wife requested for writing.

      <h2>Punch Clock</h2>
      <i>Mid 2024</i>
      <p>
        This was my first and longest ongoing project, starting as a simple CLI app to track coding hours for my dad by
        letting me "punch" in and out. Over time, I added features like work descriptions, Google Sheets integration for
        uploading entries, and a status command that showed me when to punch out to achieve a certain number of work
        hours. Recently, I upgraded it to an authenticated web app on my personal server, allowing for centralized time
        tracking accessible from any device, anywhere.

      <h2>RPi Go Webserver</h2>
      <i>Mid 2024</i>
      <p>
        The webserver hosting the website you are currently viewing this on is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The server was
        written in Go to serve the static html of my portfolio home page as well as host various backend REST endpoints
        for me to use in some of my other projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have a video demo for this quite yet to see the code, but just take a look around this site.

      <h2>Journal Bird App</h2>
      <i>Early 2024</i>
      <p>
        This is a mobile application I made while working as a TA at BYU-I. My task was to research the Angular
        framework for mobile app development. I'm really proud of how far I was able to take this project, even though I
        couldn't get enough testers for long enough to meet the publishing standards.

      <h2>Google Firestore Task Tracker</h2>
      <i>Late 2023</i>
      <p>
        Project from that class. This was my introduction to cloud storage solutions. Kinda. The API I mention in the
        video that I had used previously was for Google Sheets, which I guess could technically be called cloud storage,
        haha. But for real, this was my first time using a real cloud database.

      <h2>Expense Tracker Update! JDBC PosgreSQL</h2>
      <i>Late 2023</i>
      <p>
        This was a refactor of my earlier Java Project to use a Postgres database instead of a plain old csv file. The
        program demo is essentially the same as the one in the earlier video, so skip to 2:33 in this video to go
        straight to the code demo.

      <h2>Rust Lazy File Encryption</h2>
      <i>Late 2023</i>
      <p>
        This was another project I made in my 2-week projects class at BYU-I. This was my first foray into Rust, which I
        found really challenging to learn at the time I was building this. I'd say it turned out pretty cool.

      <h2>Java Expense Tracker</h2>
      <i>Late 2023</i>
      <p>
        This was a project I did for one of my classes in school. The class was awesome as it was basically broken down
        into 2-week sprints, agile style, and in each sprint we were to choose a new project to build and show off.
        This is one of those projects, and I was really happy with it at the time.
