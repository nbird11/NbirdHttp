  "about": "I'm a recently-graduated Software Engineer from BYU–Idaho with hands-on experience in Java, C++, and the Microsoft Power Platform (Apps, Pages, Automate, BI, custom JS web-resources).\nI currently work as a Software Developer Intern for the Information and Communication Services (ICS) department of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where I'm part of a team that maintains Dynamics 365 software infrastructure for BYU-Pathway Worldwide. Previously, I interned as a Backend Web Developer at FamilySearch, where I developed a large-scale web crawler for a Paris 2024 Olympics genealogical campaign and maintained REST API microservices in Java Springboot. During my undergrad, I also worked as a programming tutor and research assistant, mentoring peers and contributing to mobile app development research for my university.\nI'm highly adaptable and love to learn; I especially enjoy working on personal programming projects that allow me to explore new technologies and expand my technical breadth. Outside of tech, I enjoy board games, playing piano, choral singing, and editorial writing.",
